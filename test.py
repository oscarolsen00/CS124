# class to represent the graph dimensions

# nodes have an extra dimension
# weight using euclidian distance when dimension greater than 1 ortherwise weight is 

#  matrix - becusea complete so everyone conected
# randomly generate coordinates 
# weights = euclidian distance of these nodes
# list of node index to coordinates

# an MST function
